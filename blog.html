                           <p class="mb-20">
                              In the past year or so, I have become increasingly interested in the fields of Information and Data Science, particularly because there is so much that remains to be done with the huge amounts of data which are available to us in ever larger quantities. I believe that taking advantage of the data we have could greatly expand our ability to do effective research and, consequentially, allow us to gain a much more accurate understanding of the world around us.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              Personally, I am most interested in using information and data science to improve medical research and improve the accuracy of diagnoses. I believe that using computation to better interpret medical research could help doctors be better informed by giving them access to the statistical probabilities of relevant outcomes. For example, doctors and patients could benefit from having a computer calculate the probability of a patient having a disease given their family history.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              One Northeastern research project strives to improve evidence based medicine by making it possible for computers to systematically review medical research.
                              <a href="http://www.robotreviewer.net"> The Robot Reviewer </a>
                              uses machine learning and natural language processing to interpret medical literature, making it possible to largely automate much of the review of medical research. Such an advance is important because it makes it much easier to collect accurate data from a broad spectrum of published research.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              <a href="http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/research/research-projects/" >
                                 Another notable project
                              </a>
                              underway at northeastern uses machine learning to identify lesions in the MRIs of Epilepsy patients. By feeding a machine learning algorithm large numbers of MRIs with identified lesions, the research team hopes to create a program which can more accurately identify lesions.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I continue to be amazed at how much of an impact data science can and will have in the field of medicine, and how drastically better use of data could improve medical practices. At the moment, we still have a long way to go before we can be satisfied that data science has done enough to improve medicine, so I hope that someday I can make an impact on that front.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-30">
                              Information science has become more interesting to me after we discussed in class where the divide is between
                              information science and data science. I had thought that IS was primarily focused on how users interpreted the
                              information presented to them and had more to do with UX design. I now have a much better understanding of IS and
                              understand that IS is more focused on the process of representing information as data and interpreting data to gain
                              meaningful information. I also hadn’t known that data science was mostly focused on the interpretation and processing
                              of information, regardless of context. However, I feel like I now have a much better understanding of the difference
                              between IS and DS.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I also thought it was particularly interesting to learn about the divisions between different types of knowledge.
                              Particularly the process of turning tacit knowledge into explicit seems interesting to me, and I enjoyed talking
                              and thinking about the many ways which that can be done. It’s interesting to me how each of the different types of
                              tacit knowledge (experiential, conceptual, systemic, and routine) would have to be interpreted and represented in
                              very different ways, showing how a process needs to be developed for understanding each type of tacit knowledge.

                           <h3>Post 2 </h3>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I was interested to learn this week about the use of surveys and interviews to collect information. Up to this point I has mostly seen information science
                              through more of a data science lens, in that I had mostly focused on using data, and hadn’t thought much about the effectiveness of the collection methods
                              which were being used. I had also neglected to use any kind of subjective data set which would require more skepticism about its origins. For example, many of the data sets I have used in the past describe locations of things like buildings, shorelines, trees, running routes, or subway stops. Data sets like these which describe objective, easily quantifiable subjects don’t require as much thought into the collection method as the subjects which we talked about in class.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              Subjective or qualitative topics like student satisfaction (as described in the Northeastern trace evaluations) are more difficult to measure because they are more easily affected by biases like nonresponse and leading questions or social desirability. These biases must be carefully considered when building surveys or setting up interviews.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              Survey designers must carefully word their questions to avoid leading the subject to choose a certain answer, provide incentives and reminders to prevent non-response, and carefully choose who they give the survey to ensure that the sample accurately represents the population. To me, the many pitfalls of surveys show how easily they can be go astray and fail to represent the population which they claim to describe. These failures emphasize to me the importance of checking the methods of research before trusting the results of any study.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I was interested to learn about the use of common use of interviews because I hadn’t ever considered them to be a viable means for collecting information on a large scale. However, in class it seemed to be implied that they are sometimes used to collect large amounts of information. This seems difficult to implement because each interview would take a significant amount of time to conduct and because the information collected would be heavily dependent on who is conducting the interview. Two different interviewers would likely gather dramatically different information from the same interviewee. Because of this, having more than one person conducting interviews could introduce a lot of variability into the information/data that is collected. Having multiple people conduct interviews could also make information difficult to interpret because of differences in how the information is collected and interpreted from one interviewer to another. Another problem with interviews is that the people being interviewed may not be completely truthful to or behave normally around their interviewer (as is described by the Hawthorne Effect).
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           I also thought that the existence of many different statistical decision making models was interesting because I expected that maximizing expected value or minimizing loss would be used far more often than any other type of decision making. I was surprised to see that the Hurwicz and La Place models for decision making under uncertainty are also well recognized.
                           </p>

                           <h3>Post 3 </h3>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           Some of the topics we covered in class this week were interesting to me in that they depended heavily on and built on some of the topics covered in my other courses. In Fundies, for example, we are learning to build systems of classes to best represent and manage data. Once we build the classes, we must create methods to navigate and manipulate them. Working on projects for the class has shown me the importance of making well thought out and organized classes, which fit their intended use because creating a system of classes which is disorganized or not made with your purpose in mind, forces you to spend a much longer time making methods, or makes you need to rewrite the classes all together. I was amazed to see that many of these concepts I’d been thinking about over the last few weeks carried over to class in IS 2000, where we discussed the importance of creating an ontology which fits your specific use, and the difficulties that can arise if you don’t assess your scope ahead of time and fit your ontology to it.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           Meanwhile, my elective on social entrepreneurship has also been surprisingly relevant to information science. In class, we’ve spent the first two weeks attempting to define social entrepreneurship so that we can clearly determine what does and does not qualify as a social enterprise. For example, does an organization which uses a co-op model of business (giving its employees ownership, and a greater say in business ¬¬decisions) but fails to have a positive social change qualify as a social enterprise? By creating an ontology which described the many types of enterprises we could more easily define what does and what does not qualify as social enterprise. I was surprised to see that much of what we’ve learned in IS 2000 this week carried over to entrepreneurship by describing the ways which ontologies can be created and the way which they help describe complicated subjects.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           I thought that this kind of applicability of classes and ontologies was interesting because it gives evidence to the common claim that learning to program teaches you effective ways of thinking about complicated subjects. Yevgeniy Brikman, cofounder of Gruntwork, describes in his
                           <a href="http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/05/19/dont-learn-to-code-learn-to-think/">blog</a>
                           how teaching programming is an effective way of teaching algorithms, logic, information theory, and systems engineering, all of which help tackle difficult problems and comprehend difficult subjects in all domains.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           <a href= "https://youtu.be/5Z1gfgM7kzo">Steve Jobs also famously describes</a> this kind of applicability of programming by describing computer science as a liberal art and emphasizing the impact of learning to code.  He even claims that “everyone in this country should learn how to code because it teaches you how to think.” While I don’t entirely agree with Jobs’ broad conclusion that everybody should learn to code, I do agree that giving people the access to education in computer science would teach them valuable skills which would apply even outside of the world of computers.

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           In class this week we discussed the many ways that ontologies can be implemented and queried.  I was interested to learn about the more technical aspects of ontology implementation because I am currently in the process of expanding a database for my internship, and am struggling to understand the technicalities of how the database works. I’m hoping that learning some about how ontologies are implemented and queried through SQL will help me better understand how to work with the database.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           I also have been applying much of what we learned in last week’s class to my work in my internship. We had set up a form to ask our users a set of questions which wasn’t very comprehensive, thinking that it would be easy to go back and change later. When Professor Schedlbauer described the difficulty of adding fields to an already populated database, I made a new list of questions which I thought we should be asking our users and changed the form accordingly. I’m glad that we covered the material when we did because I otherwise wouldn’t have known to change the form now rather than later.

                           I also thought it was helpful to learn the <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataModeling101.html">IE and UML notation </a>for making entity relationship models because they seem like a very effective way of mapping out your ontology before you begin implementing it. The IE and UML models are very similar to the class diagrams we use in Fundies to map out our classes to more easily implement methods. The only difference is that the ER models show the number of entities allowed in each relationship, while the class diagrams only show the difference between “has a” and “is a” relationships. While it is visually useful to show the difference between “has a” and “is a” relationships, the practice of noting the number of entities participating in each relationship conveys more meaningful information, making the ER models more useful for organizing real world ontologies.

                           I was surprised to learn that there are two different types of implementation for ontologies: relational databases, and NoSQL databases. I would have thought that NoSQL databases would be used less often because they can’t be queried with SQL. However, once we discussed the merits of each in more depth, I began to understand how <a href= "https://www.couchbase.com/nosql-resources/why-nosql">NoSQL databases could be more flexible, </a>especially in terms of scaling. While relational databases still seem more conceptually useful and straightforward, I understand why NoSQL databases are used so often. I was also glad that we discussed how the many languages used for data storage and retrieval fit together. I hadn’t previously understood that XML, DTD and XSLT are generally all used together, as opposed to being used separately, in place of one another. I also hadn’t realized that XML based databases couldn’t be queried with SQL, instead I had thought that SQL could be used somewhat universally.

                           Overall, I am very satisfied with what we learned in class this week. Our last two lectures have been much more technical, and less theory driven than in previous weeks, and have given me the skills I need to do the assignments and build some confidence with database design.

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           I am excited to be working with SQL because of the powerful and far reaching applications it has. SQL is incredibly useful for entity relationship database design and management, and unsurprisingly is used very often. I will also be quite excited to learn about using and querying non-relational databases. Both relational and non-relational database design are quite relevant to many of the goals I have in data science. I have recently begun applying for summer internships in data science related areas and have noticed that most of the positons available in the data science field prefer or require that applicants know SQL and have experience working with databases.
                           <a href="http://writing.makeshift.io/pieces/why-everyone-that-works-in-a-digital-business-should-learn-some-sql">One blogger’s article </a>
                           on the subject supports my own observations by claiming that SQL is an important skill for anyone working with a digital business because SQL allows its users to easily ask any question of their datasets, allowing business leaders to have a better-informed understanding of the way their business operates.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           In researching SQL, I learned about a growing push to use less or no SQL in database design and querying. This is representative of the much larger push to get away from the use of relational databases all together. As I looked deeper into the origins of the movement referred to as
                           <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/nosql-resources/why-nosql"> NoSQL </a>
                           , I learned that the desire to move away from relational databases came from a desire to simplify design, allow for easier horizontal scaling (expansion onto other machines), and increase flexibility. However, NoSQL databases do have their downsides. They require the use of lower level languages to query, often making querying more tedious and difficult. They also lack a standard interface and aren’t compatible with the hugely popular relational databases of the past. Nonetheless, NoSQL or “not only SQL” databases are becoming more and more popular.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           As I learned about the world of NoSQL, I began to wonder how such NoSQL databases were implemented and whether they could be queried with the ease that I had seen in my use of SQL. We had learned in class that non-relational databases are usually implemented using XML, so I began my search there. I soon learned that XML can be queried using a seemingly straightforward language called XPath and that XML files could be manipulated and converted to other file types using XSLT. I now understood why the NoSQL movement could boast of greater flexibility. My experience of SQL had shown no way of putting data from one relational database to another with different class names, nor of converting a relational database into another type of file (say, XML or CSV).
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           Hopefully as the NoSQL movement continues its push, more people will benefit from the flexibility and freedom that come along with using XML databases, making it easier to merge databases together, change their class structures, and convert them to different file types. I know that I will certainly make an effort to use XML databases in the future, where it makes sense to do so.

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           This week in class we spent a lot of time discussing how to design databases using Microsoft Access. I appreciated that we put so much time into practicing Access because I now feel like I have a good enough understanding of it to feel comfortable using it again in the future. I’ve also noticed that many of the internships I am applying for prefer that applicants are familiar with Microsoft Access, so I am glad that I have had some experience with it before applying. Practicing with Access also gave me a much better understanding of how relational databases work and how the design of a database should be directly based on your set of competency questions. Since we started discussing relational databases in IS 2000, I have noticed myself thinking differently about setting up classes in Java to represent information. Up to this point I had put far too little thought into how the system of classes would be used before I went ahead and made it. Now, I first make a mental list of what I will need to use the classes for. As I design my class system, I make sure that they can answer all my questions. This way, I am probably much less likely to set up a system of classes which I will have to modify later. Using Access also gave me a much better understanding of some of the finer details of database design. For example, implementing a bridge table gave me a much better understanding of how a single element can have many of a single type of attribute. Building the links between tables in Access also gave me a greater understanding of how a one to many relationship is implemented and used.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           However, despite Access’s many perks, it does have its
                           <a href="https://sql-programmers.com/disadvantages-of-access">downsides </a>
                           . For example, it can’t support a large group of developers who want to work on the same database. According to the educational website
                           <a href="http://learnitanytime.com/4031/know-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-microsoft-access-2/">
                            LearnItAnytime, </a> Access can only practically support about 80 to 100 users at a time. Access also struggles from limits on data storage, and will create problems for users who use more than about 2GB of data, according to the same source. Access also relies on SQL for querying, which, as I discussed in last week’s blog, has its downsides, including inflexibility and difficulty converting from one database model to another. While Access may be a good fit for most small businesses or organizations, it should probably be used with caution or avoided altogether by large companies, or those which are looking to scale or merge with other organizations.

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           XPath has also been an important and meaningful part of this week’s lecture because it is such a useful tool for navigating XML data tables. I had known little to nothing about XPath before class this week, but I was glad to see that it seems like a relatively simple and straightforward language, which is very effective at querying XML. I am hoping to have the chance to practice XPath again outside of class.

                           When I’ve used R in the past, I’ve had good experiences with it. It processes large amounts of data quickly and has very comprehensive libraries for every kind of data processing I have ever needed to use. I was glad to see that we would be using R in class because I’ve had such good experiences with it in the past, and because it is used so frequently throughout the world of data science. Our use of R didn’t delve too far into how it could be used with XML and SQL, but I will be looking forward to learning the ins and outs of using R with XML and SQL.

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           While I’ve seen many uses for R in my own experience, I wanted to do a bit of research and find out a little about its history and how widely used it really is. I learned that R is written in C and Fortran and is entirely open sourced. The language is primarily used for data mining, statistical analysis, and data visualizations and has been rapidly increasing in popularity over the last few years. R is based on a similar statistical programming language called S, which was developed in the famous Bell Laboratories, where C, C++, Unix, and the transistor, among many notable technologies were developed in the seventies. R was
                           <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/pAbaE/overview-and-history-of-r" >created </a>at Auckland University in New Zealand with the goal of creating a more comprehensive tool for graphically modeling data. The researchers hoped that by giving users a comprehensive set of predefined tools (the package library) as well as the ability to easily define their own functions, they would be able to make a much more flexible tool for data manipulation.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           In addition to its modeling abilities, R is known for its ability to support matrix arithmetic and quickly do calculations that would have a much longer run time in most other languages. The language can also be extended by its library of
                           <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html"> hundreds of packages</a> which allow it to be applied to a huge number of different domains. According to the <a href= “https://www.r-project.org/about.html”>Project R website </a> itself, R objects may also be directly manipulated by C, and compatible languages like C, C++ and Fortran may be linked to at in the code.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           Some of the downsides of R include being written in outdated languages (mostly S and Fortran), making it difficult to update. R is also very reliant on its community of users to make improvements upon the language and has no central organization making major improvements upon it. Additionally, R is not always compatible with huge datasets because the language requires that objects be stored on local memory. Like any language, R is not ideal for all situations, but it seems to me to be extremely well suited to the world of small-scale statistics and data science by excelling at both data manipulation and modeling. I am planning on seeing R again in the future, as it seems to be quite relevant to the field of data science.

                           In class this week I was excited to be learning about XSL because some of the research I had done for previous blog posts showed me how important it is to the manipulation of XML databases. In my past research, I discovered that XML databases are generally considered to be much more flexible than relational databases because XML databases can be more easily changed in structure, merged with other databases, and converted to other file types. Now that we have done some work with XSL, I have a much better understanding of how the existence of XSLT is the primary reason XML databases are more flexible than relational databases.

                           After class, I hadn’t entirely understood the difference between XSL and XSLT so I did a bit of research and learned that
                           <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/WhatIsXSL.html"> XSL was a generic name </a>which described
                           <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/xslt/a/xsl-xslt-xsl-fo-differences.htm">two separate languages: </a>XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO) and XSL Transformations (XSLT). XSL-FO is used for the styling of documents, similarly to CSS. In fact, XSL-FO and CSS have nearly identical functionality but are usually used for different purposes. XSL-FO is generally used in creating printed documents while CSS is used in web design. The language that we learned in class was XSLT and is used to transform XML documents, as its name suggests. One of the many purposes of XSLT is to transform XML documents into a format that can be processed by XSL-FO.

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           In class, we learned how to reformat XML documents and convert them into CSV files. However, XSLT can also easily convert XML documents to HTML, plain text, or XSL Formatting Objects, and is often used for this purpose. Unlike many of the markup languages it is applied to, XSLT is Turing-complete and can perform computations.

                           Personally, I think that database design is a field I would like to continue exploring. However, it is not as interesting to me as the other aspects of information and data science which deal with data processing and interpretation. However, information storage is an important part of information processing, so having a good understanding of how databases work will likely be important to understand at some point in the future.

However, I believe that gaining a better understanding of secure networks would give me a much more thorough understanding of many aspects of computer science.

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           In class this week we learned the basics of computer networks, including the many differences between wide area networks and local area networks. We also learned about the devices which implement these networks, including switches and routers. I enjoyed learning the technical aspects of network implementation because I’d had a limited understanding of how routers and switches worked before watching the video. I was eager to learn that there is a big

                           We also watched a guest lecture on the internet of things which brought up some interesting ethical questions about privacy. The video talked about the
                           <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/05/internet-of-things-2/"> interconnectedness of many of the devices </a>that we interact with on a daily basis. Phones, computers, printers, even cars and sometimes medical devices are connected to the internet. These devices collect data without the informed consent of their users, who often overlook privacy policies, or are not told at all about the data collection. Collected data is then sent back to the company which made the device, to be used to inform marketing or targeted advertising. Much of the information is then sold to data brokers who sell it to anyone who is willing to pay for it.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           From my perspective, the activity of collecting data without getting a user’s express informed consent is blatantly wrong. I believe that collecting and selling such data is a violation of that user privacy because it allows a third party to look in on the action of an individual, without that individual’s knowledge. I recently took a course on computer technology ethics which likened the violation of user privacy to a thought experiment about a “Peeping Tom.” In the thought experiment, Peeping Tom sneaks into your bedroom every night and watches you sleep. He takes all the precautions necessary, such that we can be certain he will never get caught. Peeping Tom also never tells anyone about you, nor will he ever cause you any harm. Yet, Peeping Tom’s actions are clearly wrong because they violate privacy. The Peeping Tom example just goes to show that the simple act of collecting information without consent is wrong, even if that information is never used to harm the user.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           Such a collection of data may be excused if a user gives express informed consent, for which the user must be fully informed of what data will be collected, and how it will be used. However, informed consent is rarely given. Privacy policies are required to disclose the types of information which will be collected and with whom it may be shared, but they do not disclose how much data will be collected or how it will be used. Only compounding the problem is the fact that most users (myself included) don’t read privacy policies before agreeing to terms and conditions. Perhaps, in the future I will pay better attention to privacy policies and put more thought into the extent of data I am giving away.

                             Recently in class, we learned about information visualization and began making graphs and charts in Excel to better convey conclusions made from data. I find this chapter to be interesting because I think that information visualization is an incredibly important, and often undervalued step in drawing conclusions from data. Without good visualization, an information or data scientist can neither effectively convey their message, nor draw people in to be interested in the data or information, who might otherwise be intimidated by it, or uninterested.

                             My interest in data visualization dates back far before the start of this class, but I still have a long way to go before I feel satisfied with my understanding. In high school, I first became interested in computer science by working with large datasets in R to make interesting visualizations. From there, I came to college and took a course called Bostonography, which largely focused on data visualization and I learned a lot more about the theory behind creating interesting visuals. One of my favorite books that we read for the class was one called
                             <a href="https://tecnoaprendizagem.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/tufte-edward-envisioning-information-1.pdf"> Envisioning Information by Edward R. Tufte</a>, which describes the huge amount of thought which must go in to creating an interesting map or visual. Tufte describes five principles of graphical excellence. First, the visual needs to allow for micro and macro readings, so that the reader can see the data as a whole or focus in on specific pieces of the visual to gain more specific information. Second, a visual should have multiple layers to allow for multiple readings. Each layer may represent a different type of information. For example, a map may have buildings of one type in orange and buildings of another type in red, to allow the reader to distinguish between the two. Another principle states that “small multiples”, or smaller repetitive visuals within the larger graphic, are often useful in highlighting the differences between many similar things, or helpful in describing a process. Tufte also describes the importance of color in visual-making, and highlights the importance of color choice. Choosing many distinct colors, he says, is the most effective way to distinguish different elements or layers of the visual. Lastly, Tufte would say that the use of space plays an important role in showing relationships between different elements, or the movement of elements. So, in creating networks or processes, a designer needs to pay particular attention to the location of each element within the graph.

                             I was excited to learn about the use of excel in information visualization because I had very little prior experience with it as a tool for creating visuals. I was impressed with Excel’s ability to create quality graphs and charts, and with the flexibility that Excel gives the user in customizing charts. Personally, I would still prefer to use a language like R,
                             <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/data-visualization-r"> which requires a bit more work to make a basic graph </a>, but ultimately gives the designer more control over the graph and flexibility in layout and design. R also gives its users functionality which doesn’t exist in Excel, such as plotting locations onto a map. Going forward, I would like to continue to learn about both Excel and R, and to continue to improve my skills in information visualization.
