                              In the past year or so, I have become increasingly interested in the fields of Information and
                              Data Science, particularly because there is so much that remains to be done with the huge amounts
                              of data which are available to us in ever larger quantities. I believe that taking advantage of the
                              data which is available to us could greatly expand our ability to do effective research and, consequentially,
                              allow us to gain a much more accurate understanding of the world around us. 
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="mb-20">
                              Personally, I am most interested in using information and data science to improve medical research because of 
                              how dramatically diagnosis accuracy could be improved if doctors were informed of statistically probable diagnosis 
                              before giving a diagnosis to the patient. At the moment, we don't have the technology in place to make such system 
                              feasible. But I hope that someday I would be able to make an impact on that front.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="mb-30">
                              Information science has become more interesting to me after we discussed in class where the divide is between 
                              information science and data science. I had thought that IS was primarily focused on how users interpreted the 
                              information presented to them and had more to do with UX design. I now have a much better understanding of IS and 
                              understand that IS is more focused on the process of representing information as data and interpreting data to gain 
                              meaningful information. I also hadn’t known that data science was mostly focused on the interpretation and processing 
                              of information, regardless of context. However, I feel like I now have a much better understanding of the difference 
                              between IS and DS. 
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I also thought it was particularly interesting to learn about the divisions between different types of knowledge. 
                              Particularly the process of turning tacit knowledge into explicit seems interesting to me, and I enjoyed talking 
                              and thinking about the many ways which that can be done. It’s interesting to me how each of the different types of 
                              tacit knowledge (experiential, conceptual, systemic, and routine) would have to be interpreted and represented in 
                              very different ways, showing how a process needs to be developed for understanding each type of tacit knowledge.

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I was interested to learn this week about the use of surveys and interviews to collect information. Up to this point I has mostly seen information science through more of a data science lens, in that I had mostly focused on using data, and hadn’t thought much about the effectiveness of the collection methods which were being used. I had also neglected to use any kind of subjective data set which would require more skepticism about its origins. For example, many of the data sets I have used in the past describe locations of things like buildings, shorelines, trees, running routes, or subway stops. Data sets like these which describe objective, easily quantifiable subjects don’t require as much thought into the collection method as the subjects which we talked about in class. 
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              Subjective or qualitative topics like student satisfaction (as described in the Northeastern trace evaluations) are more difficult to measure because they are more easily affected by biases like nonresponse and leading questions or social desirability. These biases must be carefully considered when building surveys or setting up interviews.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              Survey designers must carefully word their questions to avoid leading the subject to choose a certain answer, provide incentives and reminders to prevent non-response, and carefully choose who they give the survey to ensure that the sample accurately represents the population. To me, the many pitfalls of surveys show how easily they can be go astray and fail to represent the population which they claim to describe. These failures emphasize to me the importance of checking the methods of research before trusting the results of any study. 
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I was interested to learn about the use of common use of interviews because I hadn’t ever considered them to be a viable means for collecting information on a large scale. However, in class it seemed to be implied that they are sometimes used to collect large amounts of information. This seems difficult to implement because each interview would take a significant amount of time to conduct and because the information collected would be heavily dependent on who is conducting the interview. Two different interviewers would likely gather dramatically different information from the same interviewee. Because of this, having more than one person conducting interviews could introduce a lot of variability into the information/data that is collected. Having multiple people conduct interviews could also make information difficult to interpret because of differences in how the information is collected and interpreted from one interviewer to another. Another problem with interviews is that the people being interviewed may not be completely truthful to or behave normally around their interviewer (as is described by the Hawthorne Effect).  
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="mb-20">
                           I also thought that the existence of many different statistical decision making models was interesting because I expected that maximizing expected value or minimizing loss would be used far more often than any other type of decision making. I was surprised to see that the Hurwicz and La Place models for decision making under uncertainty are also well recognized.
