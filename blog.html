                           <p class="mb-20">
                              In the past year or so, I have become increasingly interested in the fields of Information and Data Science, particularly because there is so much that remains to be done with the huge amounts of data which are available to us in ever larger quantities. I believe that taking advantage of the data we have could greatly expand our ability to do effective research and, consequentially, allow us to gain a much more accurate understanding of the world around us.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              Personally, I am most interested in using information and data science to improve medical research and improve the accuracy of diagnoses. I believe that using computation to better interpret medical research could help doctors be better informed by giving them access to the statistical probabilities of relevant outcomes. For example, doctors and patients could benefit from having a computer calculate the probability of a patient having a disease given their family history. 
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              One Northeastern research project strives to improve evidence based medicine by making it possible for computers to systematically review medical research. 
                              <a href = “http://www.robotreviewer.net”> The Robot Reviewer </a>
                              uses machine learning and natural language processing to interpret medical literature, making it possible to largely automate much of the review of medical research. Such an advance is important because it makes it much easier to collect accurate data from a broad spectrum of published research. 
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              <a href= “http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/research/research-projects/” >
                                 Another notable project 
                              </a> 
                              underway at northeastern uses machine learning to identify lesions in the MRIs of Epilepsy patients. By feeding a machine learning algorithm large numbers of MRIs with identified lesions, the research team hopes to create a program which can more accurately identify lesions. 
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I continue to be amazed at how much of an impact data science can and will have in the field of medicine, and how drastically better use of data could improve medical practices. At the moment, we still have a long way to go before we can be satisfied that data science has done enough to improve medicine, so I hope that someday I can make an impact on that front. 
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-30">
                              Information science has become more interesting to me after we discussed in class where the divide is between
                              information science and data science. I had thought that IS was primarily focused on how users interpreted the
                              information presented to them and had more to do with UX design. I now have a much better understanding of IS and
                              understand that IS is more focused on the process of representing information as data and interpreting data to gain
                              meaningful information. I also hadn’t known that data science was mostly focused on the interpretation and processing
                              of information, regardless of context. However, I feel like I now have a much better understanding of the difference
                              between IS and DS.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I also thought it was particularly interesting to learn about the divisions between different types of knowledge.
                              Particularly the process of turning tacit knowledge into explicit seems interesting to me, and I enjoyed talking
                              and thinking about the many ways which that can be done. It’s interesting to me how each of the different types of
                              tacit knowledge (experiential, conceptual, systemic, and routine) would have to be interpreted and represented in
                              very different ways, showing how a process needs to be developed for understanding each type of tacit knowledge.

                           <h3>Post 2 </h3>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I was interested to learn this week about the use of surveys and interviews to collect information. Up to this point I has mostly seen information science through more of a data science lens, in that I had mostly focused on using data, and hadn’t thought much about the effectiveness of the collection methods which were being used. I had also neglected to use any kind of subjective data set which would require more skepticism about its origins. For example, many of the data sets I have used in the past describe locations of things like buildings, shorelines, trees, running routes, or subway stops. Data sets like these which describe objective, easily quantifiable subjects don’t require as much thought into the collection method as the subjects which we talked about in class.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              Subjective or qualitative topics like student satisfaction (as described in the Northeastern trace evaluations) are more difficult to measure because they are more easily affected by biases like nonresponse and leading questions or social desirability. These biases must be carefully considered when building surveys or setting up interviews.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              Survey designers must carefully word their questions to avoid leading the subject to choose a certain answer, provide incentives and reminders to prevent non-response, and carefully choose who they give the survey to ensure that the sample accurately represents the population. To me, the many pitfalls of surveys show how easily they can be go astray and fail to represent the population which they claim to describe. These failures emphasize to me the importance of checking the methods of research before trusting the results of any study.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                              I was interested to learn about the use of common use of interviews because I hadn’t ever considered them to be a viable means for collecting information on a large scale. However, in class it seemed to be implied that they are sometimes used to collect large amounts of information. This seems difficult to implement because each interview would take a significant amount of time to conduct and because the information collected would be heavily dependent on who is conducting the interview. Two different interviewers would likely gather dramatically different information from the same interviewee. Because of this, having more than one person conducting interviews could introduce a lot of variability into the information/data that is collected. Having multiple people conduct interviews could also make information difficult to interpret because of differences in how the information is collected and interpreted from one interviewer to another. Another problem with interviews is that the people being interviewed may not be completely truthful to or behave normally around their interviewer (as is described by the Hawthorne Effect).
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           I also thought that the existence of many different statistical decision making models was interesting because I expected that maximizing expected value or minimizing loss would be used far more often than any other type of decision making. I was surprised to see that the Hurwicz and La Place models for decision making under uncertainty are also well recognized.
                           </p>

                           <h3>Post 3 </h3>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           Some of the topics we covered in class this week were interesting to me in that they depended heavily on and built on some of the topics covered in my other courses. In Fundies, for example, we are learning to build systems of classes to best represent and manage data. Once we build the classes, we must create methods to navigate and manipulate them. Working on projects for the class has shown me the importance of making well thought out and organized classes, which fit their intended use because creating a system of classes which is disorganized or not made with your purpose in mind, forces you to spend a much longer time making methods, or makes you need to rewrite the classes all together. I was amazed to see that many of these concepts I’d been thinking about over the last few weeks carried over to class in IS 2000, where we discussed the importance of creating an ontology which fits your specific use, and the difficulties that can arise if you don’t assess your scope ahead of time and fit your ontology to it.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           Meanwhile, my elective on social entrepreneurship has also been surprisingly relevant to information science. In class, we’ve spent the first two weeks attempting to define social entrepreneurship so that we can clearly determine what does and does not qualify as a social enterprise. For example, does an organization which uses a co-op model of business (giving its employees ownership, and a greater say in business ¬¬decisions) but fails to have a positive social change qualify as a social enterprise? By creating an ontology which described the many types of enterprises we could more easily define what does and what does not qualify as social enterprise. I was surprised to see that much of what we’ve learned in IS 2000 this week carried over to entrepreneurship by describing the ways which ontologies can be created and the way which they help describe complicated subjects.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           I thought that this kind of applicability of classes and ontologies was interesting because it gives evidence to the common claim that learning to program teaches you effective ways of thinking about complicated subjects. Yevgeniy Brikman, cofounder of Gruntwork, describes in his
                           <a href="http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/05/19/dont-learn-to-code-learn-to-think/">blog</a>
                           how teaching programming is an effective way of teaching algorithms, logic, information theory, and systems engineering, all of which help tackle difficult problems and comprehend difficult subjects in all domains.
                           </p>

                           <p class="mb-20">
                           <a href= "https://youtu.be/5Z1gfgM7kzo">Steve Jobs also famously describes</a> this kind of applicability of programming by describing computer science as a liberal art and emphasizing the impact of learning to code.  He even claims that “everyone in this country should learn how to code because it teaches you how to think.” While I don’t entirely agree with Jobs’ broad conclusion that everybody should learn to code, I do agree that giving people the access to education in computer science would teach them valuable skills which would apply even outside of the world of computers.
