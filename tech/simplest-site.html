                        I've often felt, as someone who claims to be a software engineer that any personal
                        website I have needs to be the perfect representation of my skills; well designed, with my favorite framwork of the hour, 
                        well-selected component libraries, clever graphics, and each element perfectly designed to be reusable. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, I realized some time ago that this drive for perfection was restraining me from
                        making a website at all. Afterall, I have a job that I enjoy, that generally feels meaningful, and when I have an
                        afternoon where I feel like spending time making well-crafted software, I figure I might as well
                        contribute to <a href="depmap.org" target="_blank">depmap.org</a> or a similar project where I can 
                        make a meaningful impact. I'm not inclined to spend my free moments polishing the one piece of software that
                        no one's likely to see. And so my personal website has continued to languish over the years. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm restarting it today and seeing if this time, it might stick. The one change being that this will be the simplest
                        website I've ever made. Almost entirely HTML and CSS, unless I really get a wild hair - and more focused 
                        on the content than anything else.
