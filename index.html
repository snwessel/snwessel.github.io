						<h2>What is the Boston Running Project?</h2>
						<p>Long ago, on a continent not so far away, there were once tribes of humans that would run. Run across the plains of Africa.
						Run so far and so fast as to outrun their prey. Over the tens of millennia since those days mankind has continued to run.
						Not just for survival but also for sport and for personal improvement.
						These days, we in the city of Boston, eek out time from our busy lives to run.
						The difficult part is where to run. Do we run on the sidewalks, along the river, or through trails in the parks?
						Questions dealing with where, when, and why rack our minds when deciding on a new route. We set out to show how Boston runners choose where to run.
							By analyzing thousands of running routes and comparing their densities
							to the density of trees and pedestrians throughout the city, we hoped to find
							a correlation which would indicate that runners choose their routes based on their surroundings. </p>

							<h3 class="title">Running Routes</h3>
							<p>Here is a basic heatmap of the running routes in boston. This heatmap was generated using R which in turn used data collected using Python from the MapMyRun API. The current iteration of this heatmap uses 1600 different routes to show the areas that people run in. As you can see there is quite a few routes that go through the center of the city. It seems to radiate out from the center of the city along major streets. A possible reason for the routes to be centered on the center of the city is because when we pulled data from the MapMyRun API we used a point fairly close to the Boston Commons. This could very well account for this effect as only the closest of the routes might have actually been pulled from the API.	</p>

							<h3 class="title">Pedestrians and Bikes</h3>
							<p>The map above is a heat map of pedestrian/bike density in Boston. We used a pedestrian/bike count database, which is a collection of pedestrian sighting that we found on the Boston Region MPO Website, to generate this heat map using R. The darker each area on the map is, the higher the density of pedestrians and bikers is in that area. You can clearly see that the areas near the edge of the Charles river and Boston commons have the highest concentration of pedestrian and bikers. Respectfully, the density decreases as you go towards the North End, and further North. You can also see that Backbay is also an area of high concentrations, equally areas around Fenway had high densities. However, south Boston has the lowest concentration in Boston. </p>

							<h3 class="title"> Parks and Greenery</h3>
							<p>Above is a basic heatmap of trees in Boston which we are using represent greenspace
								throughout the city. To make this map we used a set of data, collected by the city
								which describes the location of every tree within city limits. Each point on the map is set at a low opacity 
								so that overlapping points create dark zones, indicating more densely vegetated areas. From the heatmap, we 
								can clearly see that areas like the South End, Backbay and Beacon Hill are particularly tree lined while a few 
								neighborhoods like the financial district and the area just South East of the highway are almost completely treeless.

							<h3 class="title">Running Around Pedestrians</h3>
							<p>This overlay is a little more complicated than the parks overlay to the right. While there is a high volume of pedestrians and bicycles going throughout the city there is quite a high volume around Back Bay and the West End up into Cambridge. However there are quite a few running routes that go through this area as well. This would seem to suggest that where people run is not impacted by where pedestrians walk and cyclists cycle. Though runners do run where bikes largely cannot (see Eastern and downtown Boston), they also run where they can and do. One thing to take notice of is the intersection of runners and cyclists on and especially at the Boston ends of the Charles and Longfellow bridges. If the City were to look into the dynamics of runners relative to other pedestrians, these would be the most pertinent areas of focus.</p>

							<h3 class="title"> Running in Parks</h3>
							<p>This heatmap overlays the major running routes with the parks and vegetation in Boston. The number of runners in an area controls the opacity of the cell, and the number of trees control the color. Unfortunately, we did not take into account trees in Cambridge, which explains the entirely gray cells there. Observing the graph, it would appear that runners generally do not travel where there isn't at least some scenery. Besides some gray in southern downtown where there are major highways (something the City of Boston might want to look into for immproving scenery), and the gray line around the breakwater of Pleasure Bay, running routes largely coincide with scenic areas. Some particularly scenic and well run areas are the coastline between the two bridges, as well as the larger swath spanning from BU to downtown. </p>

							<h3>What Running Maps Have to Teach Us</h3>
							<p>So what does all of this tell us? Well it is quite diffucult to draw any conclusive observations about any trends or patterns, however the heat maps to suggest a few things. Firstly that people do seem to run in the areas of the city where there are more trees.  Runners also seem to avoid the same areas as where there are few trees. Areas like the South End have very few trees and almost no routes that go through them. Now this does not mean that because there are few trees runners avoid those areas. In fact to say that would be falling into the age old trap of correlation not implying causation. Just because people do not run in the place does not mean there will be few trees in that area and the same can be said about the reverse. That being said the majority of the routes that were obtained followed very green areas that also had a high volume of foot traffic.
							<br> The pedestrian and bike data overlayed with the running data is somewhat diffucult to interpret. However if you look at what areas of the map are colored closer to the red end of the scale you can see that those same places are also main running routes. This could imply some overlap, but also could imply that the places that people walk are nice enough that people also run there (or vice versa). Whichever is the case this heat map seems generally reflective of the running routes heatmap which suggests a lot of overlap between the two groups. This could suggest that runners do not care too much if they are running in places with a large volume of foot traffit or bicyclists.
							</p>

							<h3>What Lies Ahead</h3>
							<p>Going forward, there is much work to be done to better understand how Boston Runners decide where to run. If we had unlimited time and 
								resources, we would like to collect more data on pedestrian density so that we can make a more accurate map. We would also like to ask
								other questions of our running data. What time do people like to run? Do they tend to avoid streets with more cars? Do they run less
								frequently on days with bad weather? By answering some of these questions, we might get a more complete picture of how Bostonians run. 
							</p>

							<h3>So...? Do runners care about what is around them?</h3>
							<p> From the data we have collected it seems as though they do somewhat. When it comes to how asthetically pleasing a route is it seems as though there is quite a bit of overlap. However, there is also a very large amount of overlap for the pedestrian and bike data with the routes. This would suggest that runners do not take into account who they need to run around (or who they need to let ride by them) when they choose where to run. It might be the case that Boston is a overall just a nice city for runners, with an abundance of scenic and spacious areas such that runners need not micromanage their path for these things. Should the City be looking for logistical insight, we suggest taking a look at all the traffic crossing the bridge, and exiting it, as that is where there is both high and diverse traffic. To runners, we say, just go where your heart pleases: whether it be along the Charles river or a tour through downtown, you'll never be too far away from something pretty, though you may want to avoid the barren southern areas if green is what you need, or the bridges if you don't like sharing the sidewalk.
